my name is shruti thakur and i am accepting computer engineering as my 
thing to do for lifetime(mostly) and i am no longer standing in my own way to
progress in ittt i would definitely put in efforts on daily basis to learn stuff and built projects, actively apply to internships and one day one fine day that day will arrive when i will see a selection mail of me interning at a company like arcesium, google, Microsoft, cisco, linkedin, de shaw, citi, salesforce, and write that in my linkedin header as 
'upcoming summer intern @arcesium' to 'upcoming SDE @arcesium'
